# Contributing

We're happy you want to contribute to Teamtype!

Note: This document is in draft form and it's bringing up a few points that are important to us, but isn't expected to be complete yet.

## REUSE policy

We are following the [REUSE](https://reuse.software) standard for licensing our codebase.

If you have made "significant" contributions (up to your and our [discretion](https://reuse.software/faq/#when-copyright)), we would ask you to add yourself to the REUSE header of the changed files.

We will do this until the number of contributors grow too large and then switch to a [new format](https://reuse.software/faq/#many-copyright-statements).

## Generative AI/LLM policy

If you used LLMs to contribute to this project, we expect you to disclose its usage. This is important for us order for us to figure out with which level of care we should apply when reading the code and providing feedback. Transparency helps us gain trust in the code and in you.

You have to take responsibility for your contribution, and make sure that it is high-quality. In particular, you must personally understand and test all output generated by your tool. We like [Zulip's AI use policy and guidelines](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html#ai-use-policy-and-guidelines) in this regard.
